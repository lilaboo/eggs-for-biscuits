# Lina Belina - Eggs for Biscuits

Eggs for biscuits is a mini point and click story game about a 6 year old girl who collects eggs around the farmyard to exchange for biscuits that she will make into some baby food that will make her happy. Part of the Lina Belina project. 

Lina Belina - adventures of a little pirate saint, is an interactive storytelling game about the adventures of a young girl in post-war Spain. Built in Unity 3d with a low-poly aesthetic, the game unfolds in a series of action-based mini-games connected by the story narrative. Aimed at members of the women in games community as well as educational, arts and cultural institutions working with displaced and diaspora groups, the open-source project uses storytelling and easy-to-build 3d interactions to engage makers and audiences of all ages. 

The game narrative is based on the memoirs of Avelina Barbon written shortly before her death in 2013. Lina is a feisty, clever and imaginative young girl who fights for equality and a better life for herself during a time of oppression for women under the Franco dictatorship and the Catholic church in 1950's Spain. Lina and her two brothers have many adventures and use their ingenuity to make the most of things despite the life challenges thrown at them.
